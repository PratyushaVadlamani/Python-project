# Python-project

In this project I have done data analysis of titanic ship tragedy using python.

Modules used 
1.Pandas

2.Numpy

3.Seaborn

4.Matplotlib

Details

This data analysis projects begin with trying to answer questions.

1.) Who were the passengers on the Titanic? (Ages,Gender,Class,..etc)

2.) What deck were the passengers on and how does that relate to their class?

3.) Where did the passengers come from?

4.) Who was alone and who was with family?

5.) What factors helped someone survive the sinking?

All the results for these questions can be visualised from graphs that are plotted using matplotlib and seaborn.

The base data for this project is taken from kaggle's site train.csv
